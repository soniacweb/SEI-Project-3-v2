# SEI-Project-3-v2

## Evaluation

#### Project Workflow: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?
#### Technical Requirements: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?
#### Creativity: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?
### Code Quality: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors as we have in class?
#### Problem Solving: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrated that you thought through alternative implementations? (Note that this part of your feedback evaluation will take place during your one-on-one code review with your instructors, after you've completed the project.)
#### Challenges: This is our first group project at GA. There are 3-4 people in one group. We started with 4 teammates, however one day into the project, 2 of our members became seriously ill, so Aichi and myself had to complete the project within the deadline. We were proud of the final product, but there are a lot of work that still required polishing up. I'm taking the opportunity to create a The Vault V2 and continue working on it during lockdown. 

### Goals I'd like to create a functional 'like' feature and work on design and a 'swap' feature for clothing.
